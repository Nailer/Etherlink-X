# **Etherlink‑X**  
> **The Cross‑L2 DeFi Hub & Aggregator for Etherlink**  

Etherlink‑X is a permissionless **multi‑chain DeFi routing engine** built natively on the **Etherlink L2**. It enables users and developers to seamlessly bridge, swap, and deposit liquidity across **multiple L2s and sidechains** through a single unified interface, while **optimizing for fees, APY, and incentives in real‑time**.

## **🚀 Why Etherlink‑X?**

Most cross‑chain tools stop at simple bridging. Etherlink‑X goes beyond:  

1. **Dynamic multi‑bridge routing:** Splits user capital across multiple bridge protocols (Hop, Connext, Stargate, etc.) based on the cheapest and fastest path.  
2. **Incentive‑aware optimization:** Factors in yield, rewards, and fee schedules to direct capital where it’s most profitable.  
3. **Unified liquidity vaults:** Single‑ and dual‑sided pools that allow LPs to earn across chains from one deposit.  
4. **Etherlink as the brain:** All routing logic, fee sharing, and incentive calculations happen natively on Etherlink, turning it into the **hub of cross‑L2 DeFi**.

## **🔗 Core Features**

### **1. CrossChain Router**
- Main contract handling user deposits, route selection, and bridge execution.  
- Pluggable adapters for each bridge protocol supported.  

### **2. Bridge Adapters**
- Standardized connectors for Hop, Connext, Stargate, and other bridges.  
- Allow future bridges to be added via governance without contract rewrites.  

### **3. Incentive Optimizer (Oracle)**
- On‑chain oracle feeding real‑time data:  
  - Bridge fees  
  - Swap fees  
  - Reward emissions and incentives  
- Returns the **optimal routing split** for any transaction.  

### **4. Liquidity Vaults**
- Etherlink‑native vaults that pool liquidity and allocate it dynamically across chains.  
- LPs earn protocol fees + external incentives from integrated yield sources.  

### **5. Unified Dashboard**
- One tab to **swap, bridge, and earn** across 3+ chains.  
- Simple for end‑users, fully programmable for developers (via SDK/API).

## **🧠 How It Works (User Flow)**

### **Example:** Jane wants to earn the best yield on USDC
1. Jane connects her wallet to the **Etherlink‑X Dashboard**.  
2. The **Incentive Optimizer** compares yields and fees across supported L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.).  
3. Etherlink‑X recommends the optimal chain and vault for her deposit.  
4. Jane clicks **"Deposit"**, and the **CrossChainRouter**:  
   - Bridges USDC via the cheapest bridge adapter  
   - Deposits the funds into the chosen yield vault  
5. Jane can track APY and claim rewards directly from Etherlink‑X’s dashboard.
